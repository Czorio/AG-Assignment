Made by:
Mathijs de Boer (5686857)
Konstantinos Ntatsis (6591884)

Notes about division of work:
Konstantinos has little experience with C++, and no prior experience with graphics.
The apparent imbalance in division is more due to the relative speed between how fast we implement new features.

Passing grade requirements:
-	Generic and extensible RT <- Both
-	Free Camera <- Mathijs
-	Controls to move camera <- Mathijs
-	Basic UI <- Mathijs
	-	Shows FPS
	-	Shows controls
-	Supports planes (Konstantinos) and spheres (Mathijs)
-	Basic Material class <- Mathijs + Konstantinos for textures
-	Basic Scene <- Both

Additional Points:
-	Texturing using bmp <- Konstantinos
-	Directional Lights <- Mathijs
-	Spotlight <- Mathijs
-	Snell <- Mathijs
-	Fresnel <- Mathijs
-	Beer <- Mathijs
-	Multithreaded <- Mathijs
	-	16x16 Tiles
	-	OpenMP
-	Optimized
	-	Maybe? No clue what the fps will be.
	-	Will probably go below 20 fps when close to the glass sphere

Missing:
-	Triangle meshes
-	Complex primitives

Plagiarism:
Some code has been adapted from:
-	Scratchapixel
	-	The fresnel calculation
	-	Plane-Ray intersection
-	Hillsoft
	-	Camera basic code
-	Stack Overflow
	-	Small elements across the codebase that were broken
	-	Rotation of vector around arbitrary axis
