-- ASSIGNMENT 3 --
NOTE:
Running in Win32 works. x64, however, seems to not play nice with the SAH and Binning.

Passing Grade Requirements:
We implemented a Path tracer.
	-	Accumulator
	-	NEE
	-	Russian Roulette


Additional Points:
	-	Gamma correction with SIMD
	-	Depth of Field

-- ASSIGNMENT 2 --
NOTE:
Running in Win32 works x64, however seems to not play nice with the SAH and Binning.

Passing Grade Requirements:
-	Implemented BVH over >10k primitives <- Mathijs
	-	Scene contains ~92k triangles and 3 lights
-	Ray/Scene intersection through BVH <- Mathijs
-	Performance improvements over linear traversal

Additional Points:
-	SAH <- Konstantinos
-	Binning <- Konstantinos

-- ASSIGNMENT 1 --
Notes about division of work:
Konstantinos has little experience with C++, and no prior experience with graphics.
The apparent imbalance in division is more due to the relative speed between how fast we implement new features.
Another note, the texture code only works on Konstantinos' PC. As we cannot confirm that the code is correct, we did not include it in this version of the project

Passing Grade Requirements:
-	Generic and extensible RT <- Both
-	Free Camera <- Mathijs
-	Controls to move camera <- Mathijs
-	Basic UI <- Mathijs
	-	Shows FPS
	-	Shows controls
-	Supports planes (Konstantinos) and spheres (Mathijs)
-	Basic Material class <- Mathijs + Konstantinos for textures
-	Basic Scene <- Both

Additional Points:
-	Texturing using bmp <- Konstantinos
-	Directional Lights <- Mathijs
-	Spotlight <- Mathijs
-	Snell <- Mathijs
-	Fresnel <- Mathijs
-	Beer <- Mathijs
-	Multithreaded <- Mathijs
	-	16x16 Tiles
	-	OpenMP
-	Optimized
	-	Maybe? No clue what the fps will be.
	-	Will probably go below 20 fps when close to the glass sphere

Missing:
-	Triangle meshes
-	Complex primitives

Plagiarism:
Some code has been adapted from:
-	Scratchapixel
	-	The fresnel calculation
	-	Plane-Ray intersection
-	Hillsoft
	-	Camera basic code
-	Stack Overflow
	-	Small elements across the codebase that were broken
	-	Rotation of vector around arbitrary axis
